Version 1.2.5:
  Bug fixes:
  - current measurement of the whole system works now

Version 1.2.4:
  New features:
  - increase time power button has to pressed to shutdown Robotino from 2s to 5s if communication to iod had been performed
  - send status of power button over serial line to make Linux react to this and initiate a system halt
  
Version 1.2.3:
  Bug fixes:
  - stop all motors when not receiving something over serial line for more than 200ms
  
Version 1.2.2:
  Bug fixes:
  - correctly encode version information and lower bytes of system current and battery voltage
  
Version 1.2.1:
  Bug fixes:
  - do not accept 0 as target position in order not to move if external program terminates or power output is not used
  - ensure that position control can reach the upper and lower end-point positions
  
Version 1.2.0:
  New features:
  - use ea09cmd to enable position controller
    Before using the position controller make sure that:
    * DI1 and DI2 of Robotino's IO connector must be end-point sensors while DI1 senses the minimum and DI2 the maximum position
    * At the endpoint positions DI1 and DI2 must show false in Robotino View
    * Positive control points set at the power output functionblock must increase the encoder input position

Version 1.0.8:
  Bug fixes:
  - motor current had been scaled down to much so that only 0 is displayed both in Robotino View and EA09com

Version 1.0.7:
  New features:
  - switch off motors if speed set-point for all motors is 0 for more than 1s
  - if power on button is pressed for a long time we assume to have a power on switch
    and therefor shutdown power as soon as the power button is released
  - Set 48MHz as clock source

Version 1.0.6:
  New features:
  - telnet command "iodout" accepts bit pattern: "iodout 01001" is equivalent to
                                               "iodout 0 0"
                                               "iodout 1 1"
                                               "iodout 2 0"
                                               "iodout 3 0"
                                               "iodout 4 1"
  - telnet command "version" to print the current firmware version
