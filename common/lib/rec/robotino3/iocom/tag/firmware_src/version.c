/**2.0.2 with Festool charger firmware 2.0.6
2.0.1 with Festool charger firmware 2.0.5
Remove Ethernet with UDP PID controller debugging
2.0.0 Added support for Festool charger
Remove MPU6000 gyroscope support
Festool charger firmware 2.0.0
1.2.3 Send ADC configuration for every single channel
1.2.1 Check JP110 for hardware version. If JP110 is closed this is a V5 board without MPU6000 gyroscope
1.2.0 Charger firmware 1.2.0: perform -dU check only if NTC1 and NTC2 are connected
1.1.1 Option to set gyro scale over USB
      Reduce batter low shutdown to 1min
1.1.0 Support for analog gyroscope
Charger firmware 1.0.22: Check charging current in Stage2. If t>2h and I>1A go to error state.
                         Check NTC in Stage2. If an NTC is connected go to error state.
						 Check NTC in Stage3. If an NTC is connected go to error state.
						 Charger error can only be cleared by removing external power supply.
1.0.21 Manual integration of MPU6000 gyroscope.
Charger firmware 1.0.21: stage2->stage4 if t>10h
Charger firmware 1.0.20: execute stage start for 5min.
1.0.20 set/get battery minimum voltage. PB minimum 19V by default.
Charger firmware 1.0.18: -dU detection time increased to 60s.
1.0.19 enable gyro calibration only when all motors are stopped
1.0.18 reset charger(s) if no external power supply
1.0.17 speed set-point to 0 when saftey flag and saftey area breached
1.0.16 updated charger firmware
1.0.15 correct sign of gyro angle and rate
1.0.14 limit integral term, limit motor speed on warning field condition
1.0.13 new charger firmware 1.0.15
1.0.12 LED patterns
1.0.11 new temperature boundings
1.0.10 charger integration
1.0.9 watchdog 100ms
1.0.8 compiled with uVision 4.7.2
1.0.7 Show speed set-point when using external control
1.0.6 lock resources accessed from timer ISR and main loop
1.0.5 Wait 3s on S3,S4,S5 before power off. ME subsystem config takes about 1.5s.
1.0.4 Run FPGA update from timer interrupt. Now we get
correct and smooth velocity readings.*/
